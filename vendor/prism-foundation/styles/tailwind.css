/**
  * This file does not use native cascade layers, which is the recommended way of configuring Tailwind CSS.
  * However, since we currently support !important overrides inside unlayer content, this does not work as expected.
  * !important statements inside of layers take precedence over unlayered !important statements, making it impossible
  * to override those styles without defining a preceding layer or overriding using the specific layer.
  * Example:
  *
  * ```css
  *   @layer theme, base, utilities, components;
  *
  *   // Contains classes like `flex`, `grid`, etc. Marking using !important.
  *   @import "tailwindcss/utilities.css" @layer(utilities) source(none) important;
  *
  *.  // Our custom styles, which may contain !important overrides. The element could be `<div class="flex container" />`
  *   .container {
  *     display: block !important; // This will NOT override the `flex` class when using cascade layers.
  *   }  
  * ```
  * 
  * The only proper solution would be to get rid of important all together, but that requires a much bigger refactor.
  * Since we also have styling that relies on Tailwind utility classes being marked as important.
  *
